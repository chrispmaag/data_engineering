# Music Streaming: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

## Packages

This project primarily uses pandas and cassandra for working with Apache Cassandra.

## Motivation

Sparkify would like to create a Cassandra database to help the analytics team be able to understand the songs users are listening to.

## Credit

This was part of Udacity's Data Engineering Nanodegree.

## Files

The main file is **cassandra_etl.ipybn**, which contains the code to create tables and insert the CSV data into Cassandra.
